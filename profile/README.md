## Branching
Neararia and all underlying projects aim to maintain the spirit of decentralization by making information open-source and openly available. All active repositories are made public and are maintained by the Neararia team.



 `main` is the starting branch and where code used in production is found. New branches must branch from prod.
 
 `staging` is the branch where open testing may be pushed. In effect, staging may act as a test-net for new features.
 

### Creating a new Branch
1. Clone the repository you wish to contribute towards `e.g. Neararia/NEARARIA-FRONTEND`
2. Create a new branch from `prod`, branches may be made in any name, but try to indicate what a branch aims to do.
3. Once changes are made, a pull request may be made towards `staging` to add changes for testing.
4. If changes made in `staging` have been approved with no further comments, a pull request towards `prod` may be opened.
5. If a pull request for `prod` meets the minimum required approvers, the branch may be merged.
